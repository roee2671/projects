src/assignments/Ex1: this assignment calculates addition, multiplication, and conversions of numbers in different bases (2–16) and finds the maximum among them. 

src/assignments/Ex2: The task involves creating a spreadsheet program that can compute cell values, support references to other cells, and color cells based on their type: numbers are displayed in black, formulas (which start with "=" and can contain only operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are displayed in blue, text is displayed in gray, configuration errors are displayed in red, and circular calculation errors are displayed in burgundy. The program can also save and load spreadsheets to and from .txt files.
